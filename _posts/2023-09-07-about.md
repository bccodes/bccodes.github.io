# About bccodes/blog

Hi! I'm **Ben**, an engineering student at University of Canberra. I am hoping to graduate with Honours in 2025 - specializing in **Robotics & AI**. 

I will be posting here infrequently with updates about projects, hobbies, or general meanderings.

## Robots
Lately I've been getting pretty into robotics.

My programming background is long-ish but *very* patchy, so a lot of my last two years has gone into Python (of course), Java, Javascript, and most recently, C++. I won't mention Matlab right now.

ROS (Robotic Operating System) is the main reason for the C++, and what has consumed the lion's share of my time. and this is . *fine*. 

I will update projects and things in my GitHub as we go, so any programmers can point out all the bugs in my code.

## Music
Some of you may have noticed the links at the top of the page, one in particular - that's right. I have a **SoundCloud** page. It exists. I may expand this blog at some stage to include posts about music production at some point - wait and see.

## Contact
Anyone that knows me, just pick up the phone folks!

Otherwise, I have an email address provided by the uni - tell me all of your thoughts.

**Email Ben:** u3243222@uni.canberra.edu.au
